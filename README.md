# A pong-like clone with a small twist
I wrote this for fun in like 2017, don't judge the code too harshly~ :)

## Instructions

Press ESC to start (or later pause) the game

W/S for the left paddle and Up-Arrow/Down-Arrow for the right paddle

Try to keep the ball from crossing over the edge
(and here's the twist) Once it goes over the edge, try to make sure it doesn't hit the center again
